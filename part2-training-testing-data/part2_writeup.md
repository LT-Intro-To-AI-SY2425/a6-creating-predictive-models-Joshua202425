# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model is more effective because it uses random statistics every time which shows if the r squared value doesn't change much as well as if it is equal to or greater than 0.75/-0.75 which if it is proves that the model is actually accurate and if it doesn't then it shows that its inaccurate.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The r squared coefficient tells me that the model is slightly inaccurate because the r squared is very close to 0.75 but doesn't quite reach it.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I would not say my model is accurate because of the r squared value showing the age relation to blood pressure has low correlation. It seems to be for the predicted and actual blood pressure values that generally as a person gets older their blood pressure increases, but there are some exceptions.
