# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
The r squared value is 0.625793255322312, this shows that the linear regression model isn't reliably accurate since the correlation between age and blood pressure is low.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 43 years old?
The predicted systolic blood pressure is 137.46185286.
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
This model is a bit accurate but is not accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age becaus eof the weak correlation it has. Somethings that could improve the model are more statistics/values as well as other factors that determine blood pressure to make the graph more accurate.
