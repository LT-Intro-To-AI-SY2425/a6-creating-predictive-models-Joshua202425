# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
It is 0.86 which means that there is high correlation between the data in the model.
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
The model is accurate due to the high correlation between the data which is shown by the r squared value being over 0.75.
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
10 year old - $10468.25 , 20 year old - $3178.19
4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
This may be happening due to the car just not being worth anything since its may be so old and used that the model shows it is worth less than nothing or maybe it messes up the model somehow from being old and used enough.
